# elm2nix

A rewrite of [`cachix/elm2nix`](https://github.com/cachix/elm2nix) with major changes and improvements.

These are some of the notable differences:

1. You can input one or more `elm.json` files to create the lock file.
2. It uses a JSON formatted lock file that has support for multiple versions of the same package.
3. You don't have to manually generate a `registry.dat` file since it's automatically handled for you.
4. You can display any `registry.dat` file as JSON using `elm2nix registry view`.
5. There is a `buildElmApplication` build helper that allows you to build an Elm application in a variety of ways by setting options. For e.g.
    - Turn on the time-travelling debugger
    - Fail the build if your Elm source code is improperly formatted
    - Fail the build if your Elm tests fail
    - Fail the build if [`elm-review`](https://github.com/jfmengels/elm-review) fails
    - Turn on optimizations
    - Use [`elm-optimize-level-2`](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-optimize-level-2) instead of `elm make --optimize`
    - Enable minification with [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) or [Terser](https://terser.org/)
    - Enable compression with [gzip](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/) and [brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli)
    - [Show a report](https://guide.elm-lang.org/optimization/asset_size#scripts) about the changes in your file size due to minification and compression
    - Enable content hashing for cache busting purposes
    - Or completely customize portions of the build to your liking if you know how [`stdenv.mkDerivation`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#chap-stdenv) works
6. You can easily use [`lydell/elm-safe-virtual-dom`](https://github.com/lydell/elm-safe-virtual-dom) in your projects. More generally you can patch any published Elm package and make use of them in your projects.

## Usage

### Overview

In the folder containing your Elm application's `elm.json` you use:

- `elm2nix lock` to generate an `elm.lock` lock file

The lock file is used by a build helper, called `buildElmApplication`, to build your Elm application.

### Details

1. Add `dwayne/elm2nix` as an input to your flake.

```nix
inputs.elm2nix.url = "github:dwayne/elm2nix";
```

2. Add it's default package to your development shell.

```nix
outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils, elm2nix }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem(system:
      let
        pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
      in
      {
        devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
          packages = [
            elm2nix.packages.${system}.default
            ...
          ];

          ...
        };

        ...
      }
    );
```

3. Use the `elm2nix` program to generate the `elm.lock` file from your Elm application's `elm.json`.

```bash
nix develop
elm2nix lock
```

See `elm2nix lock --help` for more details.

4. Use `buildElmApplication` to build your Elm application.

```nix
outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils, elm2nix }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem(system:
      let
        pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
        inherit (elm2nix.lib.elm2nix pkgs) buildElmApplication;

        myApp = buildElmApplication {
          name = "my-app";
          src = ./.;
          elmLock = ./elm.lock;
        };
      in
      {
        packages.myApp = myApp;

        ...
      }
    );
```

5. Build your Elm application.

```bash
nix build .#myApp
```

This will generate a `result/` directory containing your compiled application in `elm.js`.

6. That's it.

You can view a full working example in the [`example/`](./example) directory.

## About

I was looking for a practical and interesting project to work on that might be beneficial to either the Elm or Haskell community, while at the same time, would extend my skills within functional programming. When I researched [`cachix/elm2nix`](https://github.com/cachix/elm2nix) it seemed to fit the bill because it combined 3 technologies I love, [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), and [Nix](https://nixos.org/), to produce a useful tool for Elm developers. At the time, I knew how to use each of the technologies to varying degrees but I didn't have a deep understanding of how `cachix/elm2nix` worked and why it needed to work that way. As a result, it seemed like a great project to satisfy my goals. Thankfully it turned out well. I learned so much about Elm, Haskell, and Nix that I didn't know before and I was able to find little ways to positively improve upon the project.
